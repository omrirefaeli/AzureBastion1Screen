Does it bother you too that when you RDP to an Azure Virtual Machine using "az network bastion rdp", but for some reason it opens up on all your screens? yea.. Use this script to RDP with only 1 screen.

# how to
1. Download [AZ CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest)
2. Run `az login` and authenticate.
3. Make sure it works with `az account show`.
4. Fill in the necessary details for your Azure Virutal Machine within the Powershell script to form a commnd of that sort:  
`az network bastion rdp --name "<bastion name>" --resource-group "<resource group>" --target-resource-id "/subscriptions/<subscriptionID/resourceGroups/<resourcegroup>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<VMName here. I.e. Serv2022-Omri >"`
5. Run the powershell script. An MSTSC windows will open and close automatically, then fill in your login creds in the MSTSC window and voil√†.
